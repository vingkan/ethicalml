## Description

All algorithms have biases, all systems have limitations, and all technologies have risks. Machine learning techniques offer the potential to produce faster, cheaper, and more consistent results, but these approaches can easily be misused. In Ethical Machine Learning, students will identify appropriate machine learning tasks, prepare training data, evaluate model performance, and discuss the impact of machine learning on diverse stakeholders. Coding activities in this class focus on analyzing and modifying programs, not writing lots of code.

Prerequisite: Completed CS1 course in Python or other equivalent programming experience.

## Learning Outcomes

- Students will be prepared to study machine learning in school and independently.
- Students will be prepared to recognize dubious applications of machine learning.

## Learning Objectives

- Students will identify tasks suitable for machine learning.
- Students will identify data and training issues with machine learning.
- Students will evaluate the performance of machine learning models.
- Students will discuss the impact of machine learning on diverse stakeholders.

## Course Values

- Ask questions to explore deeper.
- Involve everyone in group activities. (no math/CS-shaming)
- Exercise your moral imagination. 
- Reflect on your perspectives and blind spots.
