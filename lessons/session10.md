## (15 mins) Mini Lecture

Ask students to share examples of technology that is hailed as improving “the greater good.” Revisit some of the technologies from the first ice breaker from the first session. What are the tradeoffs of some of these technologies? What stakeholders benefit the most from those technologies? What stakeholders benefit the least from those technologies?

## (60 mins) Activity

Explain that the class will further explore the tradeoffs of machine learning applications and demonstrate what they have learned in this class by producing science fiction.

Show [this clip from the science fiction anthology show Black Mirror](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2N3IMKhgOA). In this episode, a woman loses her husband in an accident. While she is grieving, she learns of a new service that will construct a life-like representation of a lost loved one based data gathered about them from memories and social media. Ask students if they believe this could be a suitable task for machine learning in the future. Ask students if they believe such an application is ethical. After watching the video, ask for students’ reactions: How does Black Mirror portray artificial intelligence? What elements of their portrayal match up with what you have learned about machine learning? What elements appear to be artistic choices?

Split students in groups and ask each group to brainstorm ideas for a Black Mirror-style episode that explores the impact of a machine learning concept from this course. Visit tables to ask students about their ideas and offer feedback. Save time at the end of the session so that each group can share a two minute pitch or skit about their concept.
