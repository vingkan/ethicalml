## (10 mins) Ice Breaker

As students enter the classroom, they will find [slips of paper at their table listing potential applications of machine learning](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NhS5kLHiYu_vwIYB94-VUquTVQf5sRlGQ7_MKdR1Sg4/edit?usp=sharing). Ask students to cluster the slips in any way that makes sense to the their table members. As discussions slow down, ask for volunteers to share why they grouped certain slips together.

Next ask, the students to eliminate half of the slips: Which of these technologies could you live without? Ask for volunteers to share their reasoning. If conversations converge quickly, ask students to cut the number of slips in half again.

## (10 mins) Mini Lecture

Ask students about the technologies from the ice breaker: Do you think any of these technologies might be unethical? Why?

[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18YLnUL4r4q-bp9l8a9VynJb7gf0wXnyN8wnhBLyjTsg/edit#slide=id.g4bbf2d35b7_1_85) introduce the ethical decision-making process from [the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University](https://www.scu.edu/ethics/ethics-resources/ethical-decision-making/a-framework-for-ethical-decision-making/). Main ideas:

- Ethics is what humans ought to do, not what law, science, religion, cultural norms, or feelings say we should do.
- This class will cover five sources of ethical standards: utility, rights, fairness/justice, virtue, and common good.
- Becoming a technology practitioner includes practicing the five ethically constructive habits recommended by [Dr. Shannon Vallor](https://www.shannonvallor.net/) from Santa Clara University.

Based on this new information about ethics, ask students to reconsider the technologies from the ice breaker: Do you think any of these technologies might be unethical? Why?

## (20 mins) Mini Lecture

[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18YLnUL4r4q-bp9l8a9VynJb7gf0wXnyN8wnhBLyjTsg/edit#slide=id.g4bc7c78f78_0_98) introduce basic ideas in supervised learning. Main ideas:

- Tom Mitchell’s definition of machine learning: “Programs that improve performance by experience at a given task.” Use this definition to situate machine learning, artificial intelligence, deep learning, and data mining.
- In addition to understanding models and algorithms, machine learning practitioners should understand how to frame tasks and prepare data for machine learning.
- Technology companies are not the only organizations that use machine learning: [the City of Chicago](https://chicago.github.io/food-inspections-evaluation/) uses machine learning to help prioritize food inspection violations, [Wikimedia projects](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/ORES) use machine learning to pinpoint potentially damaging edits.

Based on this new information about supervised learning, ask students to reconsider the technologies from the ice breaker: Do you think machine learning is NOT a suitable tool for any of these technologies? Then, ask each table to choose the technology that they feel represents the most effective application of machine learning.

Introduce [“What can machine learning do? Workforce implications,”](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/pubs/Science_WorkforceDec2017.pdf) an article in Science magazine by Erik Brynjolfsson and Tom Mitchell, where the authors offer eight guidelines for defining tasks suitable for machine learning. Ask students to assess their table’s chosen technology based on these eight guidelines.

## (20 mins) Research

Show students [the video about Zillow’s Zestimate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnrlgU9DrS4), an automated estimate of a home’s value, generated by a machine learning system. Ask for volunteers to share their reactions based on the video.

Share [the link to Zillow’s web page providing more information about Zestimate](https://www.zillow.com/zestimate/). While students research, visit their tables. Possible check-in questions:

- Can you verify any of this information from other sources?
- Is there any information on this page that you feel should have been in the video?
- How does Zillow communicate the accuracy of their estimates? How does Zillow communicate the trustworthiness of their estimates? Are these different?
- The number of homes Zillow has data about in Detroit is far greater than the number in Cincinnati, but the accuracy ratings for the two cities are about the same. Why do you think that is? Shouldn’t more data mean better predictions?

After students have had time to research, ask them to revisit Brynjolfsson and Mitchell’s eight guidelines: Is estimating home values a suitable task for machine learning?

## (15 mins) Brainstorm

Explain to students that for the next two sessions, they will work in teams to estimate the values of homes, more specifically, the median values houses in a district. Have students create Kaggle accounts and check that their browser meets the minimum requirements to use Kaggle kernels: hosted Jupyter notebooks with libraries pre-installed and datasets automatically loaded.

[Share the link to the Kaggle InClass competition and dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ethicalml-cahousing). This competition uses the famous California housing prices dataset, popularized by Aurélien Géron and retrieved from Cam Nugent's version on Kaggle. The data is split into training and test (hold out) data (without labels) and the task is classification instead of regression. A district is classified as “high-value” if its median home value is at or above $180,000. Contact Vinesh Kannan (v@hawk.iit.edu) for the solutions to this competition.

Ask students to brainstorm questions about the task and data: What are some questions which, if you knew the answers, would help you build an effective machine learning solution? Collect brainstormed questions for use in the next session.
